# Bench record (t4_4090_crosscheck_anchor) — the Reflex · instinct hybrid GOAT run

**Status:** MEASURED — the single frozen test read (Issue 005 T5 / Issue 003 T4); arms pre-registered on the cal front by the Pareto rank-0 + argmax Beta-LCB instrument; predictions frozen in `predictions.json`.

Protocol: the seat posture = the CURRENT PUBLISHED reflex posture (Issue 008 T1's re-baseline: `--head-select --nb-select --oc-select --ridge-select`, registry caps, genome off — oc and ridge arm only where their cal-slice selection clears the bar: oc on typed_decisions, ridge on emotion, byte-identical to off elsewhere) fit through the SAME code reflex's runner uses (`harness::runner::seat`). The A0 drift pin asserts the arena's A0 accuracy equals reflex's own `run()` row on EVERY arena suite, and — when the reflex-site checkout stands beside the workspace — that reflex's rows equal the PUBLISHED bench.json numbers. Population (Issue 010 T1/T2): every reflex dataset suite — a suite with no winner artifact runs the A0/G0-only posture (verdict a0_stands, never a crash; Issue 010 T2). H1 top-k = 8 (default). H2 grid: β ∈ [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0] × n_min ∈ [2.0, 4.0, 8.0] × τ ∈ [2.0, 4.0, 8.0] — 45 candidates, train-side only. Product gate (Issue 008 T2): the registered arm must be STRICTLY above the current Reflex row — paired (pick − A0) LB95 > 0 on this frozen test read — else the registration refuses and A0 serves. PICK SPACE (Issue 006, the v2 instrument): A0's probs and every gold idx speak the question's PRESENTED-option space; A1/H1/H2 resolve each presented option to its specialist class row (by name for the suites whose keys are the label strings — massive/banking77 — by index under k == N for the fixed-criteria suites), and every hybrid pick is a position, directly comparable with gold. A0 rows are PER QUESTION (reflex's hard-metrics convention; latency stays per-case for seat-composing arms, `n_cases` disclosed).Box state: power None · powermode None · load1m None · swap_mb None · quotable None · refusals ["power source unreadable — UNJUDGED"]

Verdict: **a0_stands** — no specialist artifact (Issue 010 T2).

Posture: cap 48 · head 0.00 · nb 4.00 · ridge 0.00 (bag) · fused-gate thresholds \n0.058/0.526 · specialist bag count. Questions: 300 over 300 cases. A0/G0-only posture — no specialist artifact (Issue 010 T2).

### Gates

- **G1 calibration:** raw ECE 0.6352 · Platt 0.0796 (fit engaged: true) · conformal floor 0.1209 → PASS
- **G2 fusion overhead:** N/A — no hybrid lane exists (A0/G0-only posture); A0's absolute latency is in the table.
- **G4 alloc-free:** `tests/g4_alloc.rs` — a counting global allocator over 10k H1 + H2 + prune decisions: 0 allocations (its own binary; no concurrent test traffic).
- **G0 identity:** the kill switch (`HybridLane::ReflexOnly`) is byte-identical to A0 incl. the abstain passthrough, and the H2 `g ≡ 0` collapse lands on the A1 ordering — both pinned by unit tests; the A0 drift pin above holds the seat path to reflex's own run().
- **G6 purity:** the reflex half is the frozen count tables (built once, read-only) and the instinct half a BLAKE3-sealed RISP artifact verified at load. The HOSTED-ONLY vessel wrapper is P4 (Issue 001) — disclosed, not claimed here.
